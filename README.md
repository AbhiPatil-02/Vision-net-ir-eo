# Vision-net-ir-eo
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect military tanks and camouflaged human targets using a combination of Electro-Optical (EO), Infrared (IR), and Thermal imaging. The model is trained to identify concealed threats in diverse environmental conditions, making it suitable for real-time surveillance and reconnaissance applications.
